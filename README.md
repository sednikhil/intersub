# ASSIGNMENT

## Description

This project is a web application that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. The application showcases a basic yet functional system for managing data, emphasizing the understanding and utilization of these technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The project utilizes JavaScript for both server-side (Node.js) and client-side scripting.

- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node.js is used to build scalable network applications and is the foundation for this project.

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. Express.js is employed to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage data. MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling diverse data types in a CRUD application.

## Features

1. **Create (C):** Users can add new data entries to the system through a user-friendly interface.

2. **Read (R):** The application allows users to retrieve and view existing data, providing a seamless and responsive experience.

3. **Update (U):** Users can modify and update existing records to keep the data up-to-date.

4. **Delete (D):** The application supports the removal of unwanted data entries, ensuring a clean and efficient database.
